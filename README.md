Just a little extension to improve the quality of life in using ExLibris Alma.

**Note:** When your browser asks to turn off developer mode, do not do so and tell it to remind you in X weeks.==


## Features

- Support for barcode scanning of chromebooks
- More to come...



## Support

For support, private message me on Slack! I'm also open to suggestions for new features and ideas to make our library front desk experience better!
