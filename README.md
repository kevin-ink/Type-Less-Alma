# Alma Plus

Just a little extension to improve the quality of life in using ExLibris Alma.

==Note: When your browser asks to turn off developer mode, make sure to tell it to not bother you for another 2 weeks.==


## Features

- Support for barcode scanning of chromebooks
- More to come...



## Support

For support, private message me on Slack! I'm also open to suggestions for new features and ideas to make our library front desk experience better!
